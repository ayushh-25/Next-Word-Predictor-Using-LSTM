settled all my lawsuits\\nFuck you, Debbie!\\n\\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without me\\n\\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without me\\n\\nLittle hellions kids feeling rebellious\\nEmbarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis\\nThey start feeling like prisoners, helpless\\n\\'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells \"bitch\"\\n\\nA visionary, vision is scary\\nCould start a revolution\\nPolluting the air waves a rebel\\nSo just let me revel and bask\\nIn the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass\\nAnd it\\'s a disaster\\nSuch a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass\\nYou ask for me?\\n\\nWell I\\'m back\\nFix your bent antennae\\nTune it in and then I\\'m gonna enter in\\nAnd up under your skin like a splinter\\nThe center of attention back for the winter\\n\\nI\\'m interesting, the best thing since wrestling\\nInfesting in your kid\\'s ears and nesting\\nTesting attention please\\nFeel the tension soon as someone mentions me\\nHere\\'s my 10 cents my 2 cents is free\\nA nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?\\n\\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without me\\n\\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without me\\n\\nA tisk-it a task-it\\nI\\'ll go tit for tat with anybody who\\'s talking this shit, that shit\\nChris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked\\nWorse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards\\n\\nAnd Moby\\nYou can get stomped by Obie\\nYou 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me\\nYou don\\'t know me\\nYou\\'re too old\\nLet go\\nIt\\'s over, nobody listens to techno\\n\\nNow let\\'s go, just give me the signal\\nI\\'ll be there with a whole list full of new insults\\nI\\'ve been dope, suspenseful with a pencil\\nEver since Prince turned himself into a symbol\\n\\nBut sometimes the shit just seems\\nEverybody only wants to discuss me\\nSo this must mean I\\'m disgusting\\nBut it\\'s just me I\\'m just obscene\\n\\nNo, I\\'m not the first king of controversy\\nI am the worst thing since Elvis Presley\\nTo do black music so selfishly\\nAnd use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)\\n\\nThere\\'s a concept that works\\n20 million other white rappers emerge\\nBut no matter how many fish in the sea\\nIt\\'d be so empty without me\\n\\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without me\\n\\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\\n\\'Cause we need a little controversy\\n\\'Cause it feels so empty without

# Next-Word-Predictor-Using-LSTM

* **Objective:** The project aims to predict the next word in a sentence or text based on the previous words. It's like having your phone suggest the next word as you type a message.

* **Technology:** We use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, a type of AI model, for this task. LSTM is great at understanding and predicting sequences of data.

**How It Works:**

* **Input Data:** We feed the model lots of text data as input. For example, if we have the sentence: "I love to," the model learns from similar sentences in the data.
* **Training:** The LSTM model learns the patterns in the data, figuring out the relationships between words.
* **Prediction:** When you provide a partial sentence like "I love to," the model predicts the next word, which might be "code."

**Dataset:** We used Top 10 eminem songs to train our LSTM model.
